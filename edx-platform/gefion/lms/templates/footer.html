## An instantiated segment/particle support the following

## footer_segment.children: array containing the particles a segment/particle is composed of. They support the same methods described in this list
## footer_segment.options('id'): get an option from the configuration of the segment/particle
## footer_segment.render(): Render a segment/particle. The way a segment/particle gets rendered is described below

<footer id="${footer_id}" class="${footer_class}">
## The footer properties can be accesed by using the footer segment as well
## <footer id="${footer_segment.options('id')}" class="${footer_segment.options('class')}">

  ${footer_segment.render() | n}

## How particles are rendered (by priority):

## 1) The backend looks in the particle has a template in its configuration and use it
## 2) The backend looks for a template with the name of the particle type (e.g. particles/html_block.html) and use it
## 3) The backend checks if the particle has children. If so, they get rendered and concatenated as result of the parent particle render
## 4) The backend uses the final fall back which is using the template particles/particle.html
